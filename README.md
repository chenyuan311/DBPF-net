# DBPF-net
This research targets medical image segmentation with a dual-branch framework. It utilizes self-attention in the Pyramid MetaFormer encoder and employs three decoding modules with the Augmented Embedding Unit Module (AEUM) to enhance feature representation. Additionally, MaxPooling integrates attention and AEUM for effective segmentation.
